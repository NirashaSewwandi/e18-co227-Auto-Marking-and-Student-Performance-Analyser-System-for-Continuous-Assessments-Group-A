## Introduction

---

The Department of Computer Engineering uses many coding based assignments for continuous assessment of student learning. The instructors have to spend a lot of time manually marking these assignments which is not the ideal use of the instructorsâ€™ time.

Therefore, we build a system for auto marking coding assignments: **_GRADINGENIUS_**

This system supports automated recording and analysis of student performance. It shows how that particular student progressed with their assignments and what are the strengths and weaknesses of that student.

Have your ever in your life works as an instructor ?

Specially for a course like java or C or any programming related course
For a instructor definetly will give many assignments to students. And need to mark them. How to mark those programs?

Run those one by one and do all these by manually?

For our department there are 60 students for a batch and fututre it will increase. So what happen if wish to run those code one by one and need to check some test cases by run each test case. In that case, they will be definitely tired and the system would be inefficient.

Actually it is very time consuming and tough work. If there is an easier way to spend that time for teach students or for any other task, it would be great.

Our solution is automated testing which leads to _GRADINGENIUS_ platform.
Below phases add functionalities for the system


# FUNCTIONALITIES

---

#### Appication Content

- User friendly Web Interface for instructors to mark the assignments
- Auto marking processed with GitHub Classroom
- User can create courses, assignments and add students according to their preference
- Finally instructor can view the marks of the each student under each course

## Phase II - Student Performance Analyser

---

#### Appication Content

- User friendly Web Interface for instructors to analyse student performance
- Using this web interface user can easily identify the progress of each student with the assignments
- Student can identify their strengths and weeknesses

1. User ; instructor interact by using web inetrfaces
2. Extract data from web; Assignment details
3. Forward wanted to GITHUB Classroom; Auto-Grading tool
4. Generate to do assignemnt repo link, share with students
5. Students interact with instructor through GitHub platform
6. Get the marks and remarks
7. Used the automated process by Selenium for that
8. Generate results and Visualization through web application
